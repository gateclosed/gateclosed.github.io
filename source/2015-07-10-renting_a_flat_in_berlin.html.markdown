The idea of finding a place to live always fills me with mixed emotions. On the one hand there's the excitement of finding that great new flat. On the other hand you have to pack up all your stuff and lug it across town in the van you don't own. Then there's the competition. Oh, the competition. There will be lines...there *will* be disappointment. But it will be worth it, because in Berlin, there is something out there for you.

Look at the below graphic. Pick two.

You can have a spacious, cheap apartment - but it won't be close to the action. You can get a cheap and central place, but you're going to have to share a studio. You get the idea.

**Disclaimer:** This is not gospel. There are plenty of exceptions to the rule. I know a guy that's still paying the same price he paid in the 90s for a 2 bedroom flat in Friedrichshain. I'd love to hear your stories in the comments!

##What are the options?

There are many different ways to go about getting a flat in Berlin. I'm going to list a few of the most common ones below and share my experience. Please, if you have anything to add, let me know!

###Flatshare

Flatsharing in Berlin is one of the cheapest, easiest and most social ways to get accomodation. There are a heap of websites that you can search that display a whole heap of flatshares from short-term contracts to permanent.

Most ads will tell you the warm rent price, meaning bills are included.

**Pros:**

- There are a lot of flat shares in all areas of Berlin
- The social aspect of moving in with new people
- Flat shares are cheaper than living alone

**Cons:**

- Your housemate/s may be f**king crazy
- When one moves out, it becomes your responsibility to find another tenant

###Get your own place

Getting your own rental contract is great. You have the freedom of living in your own house, making your own rules. If you want to leave the dishes out for a week at a time, you can (each to their own).

To get your own contract, many landlords will want to see a SCHUFA credit check. You can get this online. They may also want proof of some of your last paychecks. If they choose you out of the **many** people who walk through their flat, you'll have to give them a bond. This is usually 3 months.

They'll tell you the cold rent price. So make sure your budget allows for utilites. They may or may not include a kitchen in the price. Many tenants are expected to bring their own kitchen, so ask the question. You'll also need to furnish the place, so get ready to spend some serious money.

**Pros:**

- The flat is yours - do what you want
- You're locked in for at least 12 months
- Privacy!

**Cons:**

- It's expensive
- The competition is fierce
- Unfurnished (most without kitchen)

###AirBnB

Once I had determined my arrival date in Berlin, I also booked an AirBnB for 2 months. I figured two months would be enough time to explore the city and find out which area I wanted to move into long-term, along with the process it takes to get the flat in said area.

AirBnB is great for a short term stay if you can find an affordable one. I chose a whole flat, told the host that I wanted it for two months and she knocked the price down for such a lengthy stay. In hindsight, this was actually the cheapest apartment we had (my housemate and I) at 700€ a month, including utilities and internet (and of course, it's furnished) in the heart of Neukölln.

**Pros:**

- Short term
- Furnished
- No bills

**Cons:**

- Short term
- It's going to be more expensive

###Expat Rentals

I was completely against expat rentals before coming to Berlin. In a strange twist of events, I now live in one.  

After my AirBnB rental, I came across an expat rental company online and went to look at an apartment. It was big - really big, and it was a 9 minute tram to work in Mitte, a 15 minute walk down to Warschauer Str. and the bars in Friedrichshain. There were plenty of supermarkets nearby and there was one of the best parks in Berlin on our doorstep. 

It was also furnished and all bills were included in the rental price of 900€ a month (between two of us). I could probably find a similarly sized house (2 bedroom, big kitchen, balcony) in the same street on my own contract for about 600€ a month - but I'd need to add utilities and internet on a monthly basis, and have a big initial layout for a kitchen, washing machine and all furniture. Who knew matresses were so damn expensive!?

**Pros:**

- Short/medium/long-term
- Furnished
- Bills included
- Internet

**Cons:**

- Slightly more expensive
- Not that many apartments to choose from
