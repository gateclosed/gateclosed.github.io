As you might have assumed from the title, I'm not that conscious about what I eat. I love to eat out. In fact, eating out is one of my hobbies. I love to try new places, and I love to cook. Let's face it - a lot of great tasting food is unhealthy. I'm not here to tell you what you should be eating. That would make me a hypocrite.

But when I saw an ad on Vimeo with Kelly Slater about Chia Pods, they mentioned that there was just three ingredients. Here's the video:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/119084184' frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
<br/>

Then I did a little research of my own. (Allegedly) Chia seeds are a 'superfood' and are packed with a whole bunch of great stuff - fibre, omega-3, bla bla bla...

Most days I skip breakfast. I know that's bad, but I'm lazy and I'm not a morning person. So when I saw a few videos of people making "Chia Pudding", I thought that it might just be the perfect breakfast to prepare the night before, whack in the fridge and take it to the office with me of a morning.

A lot of the recipes on YouTube and food blogs use a whole heap of ingredients. You can make these chia puddings so many ways. But they all work off the basis of adding liquid to chia. That's it. As you already know, I'm lazy when it comes to breakfast, so here's my version of a two ingredient chia pudding. I was doubtful that i'd like it but it was really good, and suprisingly filling.

Stir it all up (I actually put the lid on and shook it up).

Put it in the fridge, and shake/stir it up about an hour later - you'll notice how much thicker it has become
