Berlin is a relatively cheap city compared to other Euro-capitals. That said, its not what it used to be. It is the only city in Germany with a declining population, yet rent prices are on the rise due to an influx of expats like myself. Some locals (what's left of them) are understandably sour about being forced out of their beloved, poor-but-sexy Berlin.

##Cost of accomodation in Berlin

You won't find a whole bunch of people buying houses in Berlin. It's a renter's game here and, of course, for an expat it makes sense to rent due to majority of us staying short-medium term.

A shared flat in the city center will run you about 400€ warm/month (including utilities). Areas that were once much cheaper like Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg will now be on the upper end of that scale because of their proximity to nightlife, cafe's, galleries and the like. There are still bargains to be found in Neukölln, which is catching up fast to the other 'hipsterfied' areas.

If you want a real bargain, get outside the S-Bahn ring. The commute to hotspots will be longer, but you'll be able to find a room for about 300€

##Cost of nightlife in Berlin

Clubs with a reputation will cost you between 15€ and 25€ just to get in. In general though, 5-8€ is a standard entry price. Bars are free to enter and often have live music. There are a lot of restaurants that get pretty vibey and you may end up staying there for a good chunk of your night after dinner for a few drinks.

##Cost of food and drinks in Berlin

Of course, this will depend on what you want to eat and drink, but I've found that drink prices is pretty standardized.

4€ for a beer is on the expensive side. Most bars and clubs sit at about 3.50€ for a beer, and they will choose whether they want to add *Pfand*. *Pfand* is a deposit you pay on the glass when you buy your first drink. They'll give you a token in exchange for ~2€. When you finish your drink, you bring back your glass, return the token and get your money back.

A half-liter of beer from a kiosk will set you back around 1€.

Eating out in Berlin is very reasonable. Most mid-range restaurants will cost you about 8-10€ for a main, service included. There are super-expensive, Michelen starred restaurants too - expect to empty your wallet at these.

Fast food is expensive in Berlin. You won't get away under 10€ at KFC for a meal-combo. 

A döner Kebap will cost you 3.50€ - beware, there are plenty of dodgy ones.

##Cost of getting around 

Transport is fairly cheap in Berlin. A one way ticket that's valid for 2 hours in one direction will cost you 2.70€ in the AB zone. You can use the Bus, U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Tram and Ferry.

If you only need to go a short distance - defined as 3 U/S-Bahn stops or 6 Bus/Tram stops - opt for a 1.70€ Kurzstrecke (short-trip).

A 7-Day pass will cost you 29.50€ for unlimited travel, a monthly 79.50€ and 700€ish for a yearly.

Taxis start on 3.30€ and charge about 1.80€/km.

##Cost of health insurance

Health insurance is compulsory. If you're on a [Working Holiday Visa](../working_visa_in_germany), travel insurance will be enough for legality. If you are living and working here though, you'll want to get some form of public/private insurance so you can visit the doctor or go to hospital if you need to.

If you're a freelancer, you'll need to get private health insurance. 

If you work for a German based company, you can get public insurance which is subsidised. Your employer will deduct the health insurance payments from your salary - the amount is based on what you earn. You need to specify which company you want to be insured with.

I pay about 300€ a month.

##Monthly Budget

Now this is going to significantly vary from person to person, but based on the above information here's a quick monthly budget if you couldn't be bothered reading the whole thing. This is from my own experience of living comfortably near the center of town, going out a few times a week and factoring in my insurance.
