Fried chicken is one of my favourite foods, hands down. Since moving to Berlin, I've been on the hunt for the city's best. Fried chicken in a major city shouldn't be too hard to find, right? Wrong. So wrong. 

Of course, you have the usual suspect: KFC. But that's not the fried chicken I'm talking about. I'm talking about golden, crispy, perfectly seasoned goodness housing moist, REAL chicken. Don't get me wrong - there's so many places to get amazing chicken, its just not in the style that I get a craving for every once in a while (usually a Sunday afternoon after a few too many Weißbiere).

In steps Risa Chicken. Their [website](http://chickenrisa.de/index.php/uber-uns){:target="_blank"} proclaims:

> "Grillhähnchen auf echtem Holzkohlengrill-Immer frisch - immer knusprig - immer lecker". Grilled chicken on real wood charcoal grill - always fresh - always crispy - always delicious. I wasn't there for the grilled chicken though, I wanted the fried stuff!

Risa Chicken sits on the corner of Sonnenallee and Reuterstr in the heart of Neukölln (how the hell did I not know about this place when I lived 3 minutes away?). They also have Tempelhof and Moabit locations. I jumped on my bike and headed south across the canal.

My hopes were high as I parked my bike across the street. I could see the place was packed, but that wasn't going to stop me on my quest for BFC (Berlin Fried Chicken). Luckily, the queue wasn't too big when I got inside and I ordered 6 pieces of "Chicken Kross" and they told me it was going to be about 20 minutes. I asked for it take-away since the place was packed and I thought they might push it out faster, as some places do. 

I looked around the shop while I waited. There were pictures of Lebanon on the walls, so I'm hazarding a guess that's where the owner is from. In any case, Arabic was the main language being spoken - but the staff can speak German and English just fine, so it's tourist friendly.

Sure enough, 10 minutes later my number was called and there were two take-away boxes sitting on the counter. I was under the impression that I was ordering tenderloins or similar. Alas, there were 6 huge breast portions. I jumped back on my bike and high tailed it to the flat.

The two boxes:

Well, Risa did not disappoint. OK, I've had better fried chicken in my lifetime, but it was pretty bloody good. Seasoning was great, chicken was still moist, even after the 15 minute ride home. Another point for the actual crispiness, you could hear the crunch in every bite unlike some other proprieters...looking at you, Colonel Sanders.

I'd give this place a 4/5 stars. Staff were friendly enough, especially considering how busy it was. The chicken does exactly what it says on the tin: Fresh, crispy, delicious! If you're in the area, check it out.

**Price:** 6 pieces of fried chicken breast: 7.09€ as of 18 July, 2015.

**Location:** Sonnenallee 26, 12047 Berlin
