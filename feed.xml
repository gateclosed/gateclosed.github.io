    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lets start by saying that this is no easy task. I overheard a conversation with two guys a while back - &lt;em&gt;Guy 1&lt;/em&gt; was a house-painter by trade. He was ready to work - would bring his van over from London, with all his brushes and rollers and make a lift in Berlin. Simples. &lt;em&gt;Guy 2&lt;/em&gt; told him, in no uncertain terms, that for every one of him, there were 100 Polish house-painters who were willing to work longer, harder and for less money than he was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't know about Polish painters or their work ethic, but what I do know is that as an Australian in Berlin it's tough to find work. The figures speak for themselves. Currently unemployment in Berlin is at 10.8%. That's high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Unemployment in Berlin" src="/images/unemployment-67f97877.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="patience-is-a-virtue"&gt;Patience is a virtue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first piece of advice I can give you is to be patient. With unemployment so high, everybody is vying for the same jobs. You may not (I certainly hope you do!) fall into a job in the first week of getting your &lt;a href="../working_visa_in_germany/"&gt;Working Visa&lt;/a&gt;. It may even take a couple of &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt;. Be prepared. Bring enough money to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pick-the-right-industry"&gt;Pick the right industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are jobs that are well suited to expats, travelers, backpackers and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a 'Tech Professional', as it were. Berlin is the 'Silicon Valley of Europe' and so there were a lot of Tech positions in Startups that I had the opportunity of applying for. &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://berlinstartupjobs.com"&gt;Berlin Startup Jobs&lt;/a&gt; was a great resource for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain jobs that are really well suited to backpackers and travelers. They may not be what you do back at home, but if you're more about working to live in Berlin, then they might be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tour Guide.&lt;/strong&gt; If you know a bit about history, look into running walking tours with a group like &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.neweuropetours.eu/work-with-us.html"&gt;Sandeman's&lt;/a&gt;. It's tip based, so you'll have good days and bad days, but from what I've worked out when participating on these tours - good days are very good. Summer is better, for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hostel Jobs.&lt;/strong&gt; This one is kind of obvious, but worth mentioning. Hostels are looking for expats to engage their customers. The job isnt glamourous - you'll clean toilets and make beds, but you might snag a free room, if you can hack living where you work. It also won't be very well paid, but you can survive Berlin on a budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bar Work.&lt;/strong&gt; This will be infinitely easier if you have a basic grasp of the German language, but there are plenty of bars and clubs around who will give you a job running glasses or mopping the floor. A lot of these places pay cash and the work may be sporadic - don't be disheartened if they let you go…it's not because you're shit at cleaning floors, when they can't afford you, they can't afford you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cafes/Restaurants.&lt;/strong&gt; There is an ever growing presence of English-speaking eateries in Berlin. A lot of these places don't cater to the German language whatsoever, so finding a job in an American burger joint for example, may be an option worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Office Work.&lt;/strong&gt; With the Tech boom in Berlin comes a whole heap of physical offices. Even if you aren't technically inclined, these offices still have needs for general office duties. Receptionists assemble: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://berlinstartupjobs.com"&gt;Berlin Startup Jobs&lt;/a&gt; is your best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your skills to Freelance.&lt;/strong&gt; Good with websites? Perhaps you're a budding copywriter. An artist or DJ? Freelance Visas aren't that hard to come by and if you can successfully build up a client base in Berlin you can live comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="learn-german"&gt;Learn German&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can get a good grasp on the German language, you'll open up previously deadbolted doors. Telesales, shop assistants, retail, office jobs - you name it. You can cast a much larger net if you have at least conversational German language skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out a list of schools &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mydestination.com/berlin/travel-articles/722695/top-10-language-schools-in-berlin"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="persist"&gt;Persist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that said, it might seem like mission impossible to land a great job in Berlin. The truth is, it's quite tough, but I can't think of many better European capitals to be unemployed in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't give up. Persistance is the key to landing any job, and Berlin is no different. Make sure you have enough savings when you arrive so that you can live comfortably without a job for a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave me a comment below with any tips or tricks you've got for finding work in Berlin!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a topic that springs up at least once a month when talking to other travelers and expats. Everybody seems to have a story on the best way to get a Working Holiday Visa. The truth is, there aren't any secrets or tricks - but in good old German fashion, you DO have to follow a particular method. Read on and I'll explain the necessary steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been living in Berlin since June 2014. I came here after spending 6 weeks in Portugal and a couple of weeks in London. The plan was to get my Working Holiday Visa, stick around for a year and then go home. I'm now in my 13th month (with a valid Visa, woohoo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process I outline below comes from my own experience as an Australian national, but I know the process is identical for New Zealand and Chilean residents, and similar for Americans, Canadians and Japanese citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-easiest-but-not-necessarily-best-way-to-organise-a-working-holiday-visa"&gt;The easiest (but not necessarily best) way to organise a Working Holiday Visa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do it at home. This is the simplest way &lt;strong&gt;if you time it perfectly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fill in your &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.australien.diplo.de/contentblob/3975340/Daten/4777782/FormularDVisum.pdf"&gt;paperwork&lt;/a&gt;, make an appointment at the Consulate, submit your &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.australien.diplo.de/Vertretung/australien/en/Visa/Working-Holiday.html"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; and wait two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, but…if your Working Holiday Visa starts before the time you enter Germany, you are wasting time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-best-way-to-organise-a-working-holiday-visa"&gt;The best way to organise a Working Holiday Visa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right. Its quite a process, but fear not. Many have done it successfully before you, and I'm here to guide you through it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people get very nervous when they start applying for a Working Holiday Visa. This is one of the easiest German Visas to obtain. So don't stress, and remember:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Working Holiday Visa Programme is based on a bilateral agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and Australia (also with New Zealand, Japan and Chile) and aims at enabling young Australian citizens to gain an insight into the culture and daily life of the Federal Republic of Germany, allowing them to travel to Germany for a stay of up to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a mutual agreement between both countries. You have the right to apply and be there - regardless of how the woman on the other side of the counter is making you feel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="step-minus-one-wait-three-months"&gt;Step Minus-One: Wait three months&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right. Wait it out. Why? When you enter Germany, as an Australian you have 90 days as a tourist before you're obligated to leave (or get your Visa). What this means is that you can spend 15 glorious, legal months in old Deutschland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downside:&lt;/strong&gt; You can't start work until you get your Visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="step-one-register-an-address-in-germany"&gt;Step One: Register an address in Germany&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first thing you should do is get to a &lt;strong&gt;Bürgerämt&lt;/strong&gt; and get your &lt;strong&gt;Anmeldung&lt;/strong&gt;. You have 14 days to do it, but I find they are lenient on that - still, Germany being Germany, do it ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;Anmeldung&lt;/strong&gt; is the registration of you living at an address in Germany. A common misconception is that you must go to your local &lt;strong&gt;Bürgerämt&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not true. You may go to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; office to register your address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Berlin, you can find a list of &lt;strong&gt;Bürgerämter&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://service.berlin.de/standorte/buergeraemter/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I would recommend making a booking online to avoid long waiting times, or getting there at least an hour before opening time to get an appointment for that day - even then, you may have to wait for a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring along your passport and your rental contract if you have one. If you are staying with friends, bring a translated letter saying you are staying at their house. If you are staying at a hotel/hostel, bring your booking confirmation (and produce it only if asked).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will get your &lt;strong&gt;Anmeldung&lt;/strong&gt; on the spot. This is free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your address is temporary, remember that when you move, you must complete this process again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="step-two-gather-your-documents"&gt;Step Two: Gather your documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have your &lt;strong&gt;Anmeldung&lt;/strong&gt;, the rest should be easy. You need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Valid passport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 current biometric photo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;35mm x 45mm biometric passport photo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foreign travellers’ health insurance that is valid for one year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof of funds in the amount of at least 2,000 Euros e.g. bank statement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the form “Antrag auf Erteilung eines Aufenthaltstitels" (Application for Issuance of a Residence Permit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="step-three-go-to-the-gates-of-hell"&gt;Step Three: Go to the Gates of Hell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you've registered your address, collected your documents and you're ready to start work. Now all you need is the damn Visa. You're almost there! The problem however, is that you're not the only one who wants a Visa, and there's only one place you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's called the &lt;em&gt;Landesamt für Bürger- und Ordnungsangelegenheiten&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Ausländerbehörde&lt;/strong&gt; and it looks like something out of Nazi Germany (in Berlin anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ausländerbehörde" src="/images/auslandebehorde-84ef782b.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same deal as the &lt;strong&gt;Bürgerämt&lt;/strong&gt; but with longer lines. Booking online is pretty much essential. You can probably even do it before you arrive, because the waiting list for appointments is long. The good news is that once you have that appointment, you are no longer tied to the 90 day tourist limit, so don't worry about making it before the cutoff if you've left it a little bit late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make an appointment in Berlin go &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://formular.berlin.de/xima-forms-29/nextpage/f2afb9c3-a3fa-4a68-9bdd-802d090edfa9/;jsessionid=F03AD6D614881368ADC616376E4F52F9"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="step-four-enter-the-gates-of-hell"&gt;Step Four: Enter the Gates of Hell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's at this point that people really start to freak out. They've heard fairytales and they've heard nightmares. They frantically post in forums about the best tactics, tips and tricks. They try and drag their German-speaking friends along to help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need to do any of that. Okay, nobody will speak to you in English. But if you've filled out your form correctly, have the rest of the documentation and are on time to your appointment, you'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your number will flash up on the screen, just like in the deli, and tell you which room to go to. Walk down the hall and find the corresponding room. Knock, enter, find the desk and present your paperwork. Approximately three minutes later, s/he'll ask you for €50 - the website says &lt;em&gt;50 to 110 euros (depending on the effort)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; They may ask you how long you want it for. I've heard cases of people getting two years. Try your luck if they ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you pay (you'll need to go downstairs to pay with a card, try to bring cash) they'll send you back out to the waiting room while they process your Working Holiday Visa. This will take however long is left on your appointment (I suspect this isn't by mistake, they aren't exactly go-getters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, your number will flash up on the deli-screen. This time, walk in with a big smile on your face and collect your passport. You won't collect $200 but you'll feel pretty good with the &lt;strong&gt;Ausländerbehörde&lt;/strong&gt; at your back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats, you can now work in Germany!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="step-five-congratulations-have-a-beer"&gt;Step Five: Congratulations! Have a beer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got walked out with my new Working Holiday Visa, I did the most stereotypical thing I could think of. I was living in Neukölln at the time, so I went to a Kebap shop on Hermannstr., ordered a Döner and a Sternburg and ate it in Tempelhofer Feld. This step isn't compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, go forth and get yourself a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in Berlin? Berlin's unemployment rate is 10.8%, and there are plenty of people out there with EU passports who are willing to work for less than you.&lt;/p&gt;
