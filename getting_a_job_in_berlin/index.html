          Getting a Job in Berlin
        </h1>

            <time>Jul 10 2015</time>
          </p>
          <p>Lets start by saying that this is no easy task. I overheard a conversation with two guys a while back - <em>Guy 1</em> was a house-painter by trade. He was ready to work - would bring his van over from London, with all his brushes and rollers and make a life in Berlin. Simples. <em>Guy 2</em> told him, in no uncertain terms, that for every one of him, there were 100 Polish house-painters who were willing to work longer, harder and for less money than he was.</p>
          
          <p>Now, I don't know about Polish painters or their work ethic, but what I do know is that as an Australian in Berlin it's tough to find work. The figures speak for themselves. Currently unemployment in Berlin is at 10.8%. That's high.</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Unemployment in Berlin" src="/images/unemployment-67f97877.jpg" /></p>
          
          <h2 id="patience-is-a-virtue">Patience is a virtue</h2>
          
          <p>The first piece of advice I can give you is to be patient. With unemployment so high, everybody is vying for the same jobs. You may not (I certainly hope you do!) fall into a job in the first week of getting your <a href="../working_visa_in_germany/">Working Visa</a>. It may even take a couple of <em>months</em>. Be prepared. Bring enough money to survive.</p>
          
          <h2 id="pick-the-right-industry">Pick the right industry</h2>
          
          <p>There are jobs that are well suited to expats, travelers, backpackers and the like.</p>
          
          <p>I'm a 'Tech Professional', as it were. Berlin is the 'Silicon Valley of Europe' and so there were a lot of Tech positions in Startups that I had the opportunity of applying for. <a target="_blank" href="http://berlinstartupjobs.com">Berlin Startup Jobs</a> was a great resource for me.</p>
          
          <p>There are certain jobs that are really well suited to backpackers and travelers. They may not be what you do back at home, but if you're more about working to live in Berlin, then they might be perfect.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Tour Guide.</strong> If you know a bit about history, look into running walking tours with a group like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neweuropetours.eu/work-with-us.html">Sandeman's</a>. It's tip based, so you'll have good days and bad days, but from what I've worked out when participating on these tours - good days are very good. Summer is better, for obvious reasons.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Hostel Jobs.</strong> This one is kind of obvious, but worth mentioning. Hostels are looking for expats to engage their customers. The job isnt glamourous - you'll clean toilets and make beds, but you might snag a free room, if you can hack living where you work. It also won't be very well paid, but you can survive Berlin on a budget.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Bar Work.</strong> This will be infinitely easier if you have a basic grasp of the German language, but there are plenty of bars and clubs around who will give you a job running glasses or mopping the floor. A lot of these places pay cash and the work may be sporadic - don't be disheartened if they let you go…it's not because you're shit at cleaning floors, when they can't afford you, they can't afford you.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Cafes/Restaurants.</strong> There is an ever growing presence of English-speaking eateries in Berlin. A lot of these places don't cater to the German language whatsoever, so finding a job in an American burger joint for example, may be an option worth looking into.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Office Work.</strong> With the Tech boom in Berlin comes a whole heap of physical offices. Even if you aren't technically inclined, these offices still have needs for general office duties. Receptionists assemble: <a target="_blank" href="http://berlinstartupjobs.com">Berlin Startup Jobs</a> is your best friend.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Use your skills to Freelance.</strong> Good with websites? Perhaps you're a budding copywriter. An artist or DJ? Freelance Visas aren't that hard to come by and if you can successfully build up a client base in Berlin you can live comfortably.</p>
          
          <h2 id="learn-german">Learn German</h2>
          
          <p>If you can get a good grasp on the German language, you'll open up previously deadbolted doors. Telesales, shop assistants, retail, office jobs - you name it. You can cast a much larger net if you have at least conversational German language skills.</p>
          
          <p>Check out a list of schools <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mydestination.com/berlin/travel-articles/722695/top-10-language-schools-in-berlin">here</a></p>
          
          <h2 id="persist">Persist</h2>
          
          <p>With all that said, it might seem like mission impossible to land a great job in Berlin. The truth is, it's quite tough, but I can't think of many better European capitals to be unemployed in!</p>
          
          <p>Don't give up. Persistance is the key to landing any job, and Berlin is no different. Make sure you have enough savings when you arrive so that you can live comfortably without a job for a couple of months.</p>
